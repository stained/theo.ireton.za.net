Over the years I've built a few online portfolios to showcase my abilities. The problem was that I'd never get around to finishing them since they could get pretty complex (based on the skills I had acquired at the time).

This time around I decided to simplify everything. This website is the end result of the simplification process.

I've decided not to include any fancy javascript (though if you prefer fancy javascript, take a look at my CV Shift project). So, it's just a straight-forward PHP-based, MVC-architected, website.

Some features of this code

* Runs on a standard LAMP stack 
* Compact MVC code
* Pretty secure as far as I can tell
* Basic blogging capabilities
* Should be pretty simple to customize
* Released under a "do what you want with it" license (no restrictions), as is with no warranties or expectations.

to get started:

* copy the private and public folders to somewhere on your server (not directly in your web root directory)
* create a symbolic link from your web root directory to the public folder
* copy private/config/system.cfg.sample to private/config/system.cfg
* edit system.cfg as necessary
* edit the database name in the db create script in db/create.sql
* execute the db create script
* this all assumes you are able to set up a basic LAMP stack.

I've committed all code and assets as it exists on my personal website to make it easier to just take it and customize it as necessary.
