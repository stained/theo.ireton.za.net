        After much deliberation (procrastination, time-prioritization, call it what you will) I finally 
        decided to re-create an online presence beyond that of your standard social networks.

    <p>
        So, this will become the final home (or resting place) of everything that I have an interest in.
    </p>
    <p>
        A place where I can keep track of the multitude of 
        <a href="/portfolio/personal">projects</a> that I partake in, <a href="/education">courses</a> that I attend,
        and even interesting <a href="/link">links</a> which may be of use (and which 
        currently resides in a Google draft email for lack of a better method).
