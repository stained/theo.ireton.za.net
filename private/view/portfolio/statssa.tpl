        I was involved in a number of problem solving initiatives as a software developer.

        One of the projects related to the
        automatic coding of natural language (textual) causes of death into ICD-10 codes using a "thesaurus" lookup file. Based on this project I 
        had the opportunity to co-author a paper analyzing such automatic coding methods for statistical data.
