        My experiments with Canvas2D to create an Android version of an old <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_boxes' target='_blank'>game</a>

        Since I'm not planning on taking the concept any further, I'm open-sourcing the existing code under an unrestricted "do what you want with it" license,
        as is without warranties or expectations.

        The base code for creating and calculating dot and box offsets (with basic scoring for a two-player mode) is there, 
        along with some graphical assets and screens, but not really much else.
