        Over the years I've built a few online portfolios to showcase my abilities. The problem was that I'd never get around to
        finishing them since they could get pretty complex (based on the skills I had acquired at the time).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This time around I decided to simplify everything. This website is the end result of the simplification process. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I've decided not to include any fancy javascript (though if you prefer fancy javascript, take a look at my 
        <a href='/portfolio/personal/cvshift'>CV Shift</a> project). So, it's just a straight-forward PHP-based,
        MVC-architected, website.

        <ul>
            <li>Runs on a standard LAMP stack</li>
            <li>Compact MVC code</li>
            <li>Pretty secure as far as I can tell</li>
            <li>Basic blogging capabilities</li>
            <li>Should be pretty simple to customize</li>
            <li>Released under a "do what you want with it" license (no restrictions)</li>
        </ul>
