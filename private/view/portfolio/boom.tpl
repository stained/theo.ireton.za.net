        boom! has a number of interesting projects that I've been involved in.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <a href='http://boom.fm' target='_blank'>boom.fm</a> an awesome music portal for local and international bands and fans. My main involvement with
        this project is from a server setup and management point of view, as well as the majority of backend development.

    <p>
        <a href='http://boom.mobi' target='_blank'>boom.mobi</a> an attempt at a mobile blogging platform (with a web component). 
        Pretty much all development, except for the actual design of the site.

        Complete development and design.
