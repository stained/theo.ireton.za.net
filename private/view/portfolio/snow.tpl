        An OpenGL-based game engine demo I was developing for Android. Far from complete (found something better), 
        but had some useful code for loading of OBJ, and Quake MD2, models.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm releasing the code under an unrestricted "do what you want with it" license,
        as is without warranties or expectations. I am certain that a fair amount of the underlying math-heavy methods
        are owned by other open-source projects, but their references have been lost to time, and bad backup strategies. 
        If you find code that you own within this project, please let me know and I'll attribute the portion to you (or remove it if so desired).
    </p>
