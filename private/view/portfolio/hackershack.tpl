        Hackershack is a collaborative effort to build a simulated Cape Town-based 
        <a href='http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/' target='_blank'>hackerspace</a>. It won't be a true hackerspace in the sense of 
        the brand (since we have neither the space or the funding), but will have similar goals (the creation of awesome stuff).
