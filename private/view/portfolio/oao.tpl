        My open-source game developed for <a href='http://www.open-aerospace.org/tiki-index.php'>Open Aerospace</a>. 
        The basic game mechanic revolves around building, customizing and launching, an initially single-stage, rocket designed from basic components 
        with specific characteristics which define the final velocity and altitude.

        This game has gone through several revisions thus far and two major technologies. My first attempt was with the <a href='http://www.stonetrip.com'>Shiva3D</a>
        engine which worked well, but was not open enough (which was a major requirement of the project). I have since started porting the game over to HTML5, but 
        ran into issues where Android clients could not play sound (up until a recent version). So, the game is currently in flux whilst I complete studies and other
        pressing projects.

        A more complete discussion of the game can be found on the <a href='https://www.open-aerospace.org/tiki-index.php?page=Game&structure=projects'>Open Aerospace</a>

        The code is not currently available as I am in the process of moving the server components into a separate branch of a framework I previously designed,
        but which I won't be able to open source. I shall make all code and assets available on github as soon as possible.
