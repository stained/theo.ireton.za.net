    <p>
        My previous attempt at creating an online portfolio, developed after-hours during the last month of 6th Line's existence (out of necessity). 
        The concept itself is solid, as is most of the code, however I've learned a lot since then and prefer to keep it 
        <a href='/portfolio/personal/site'>simple</a>. However, if you prefer an AJAX-driven
        site with complex (but decent) U.I. effects, then take a look at this project.

        Some features of this code
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Runs on a standard LAMP stack</li>
            <li>Compact MVC code</li>
            <li>Mostly secure (User code needs a rewrite for multiple user capability - less reliance on $_SESSION)</li>
            <li>AJAX everywhere!</li>
            <li>Lots of complex code that does complex things</li>
            <li>Doesn't look too bad (very "Web 2.0" by design)</li>
            <li>Framework supports multiple platforms (Web, XHTML, etc.)</li>
            <li>Released under a "do what you want with it" license (no restrictions), as is without warranties or expectations.</li>
        </ul>
